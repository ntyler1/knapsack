# Project Description

> Standalone java file that solves the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) using the dynamic programming strategy.

# Project Features

  - Input to the program is provided through a file (see knapsackTest.txt) via the command line. Input files consist of the following:
    - The input file may have zero or more lines of comments starting with 'c '
    - followed by three lines of integers. 
      - The first line represents the cardinality of the set of elements, and the maximum size of the sack.
      - the second line contains the weights of the elements
      - the third line contains the values of the elements.
  - Output its results to a file (see knapsackOutput.txt). Output file consists of entire input, the max value and the optimal value           solution set.
